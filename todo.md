adding log framework here 

go to ensure whether existing a concurrency problem 

test what happens when multiple reading and one writing in concurrency 


0.0 refactor the code, implement each function with the smallest core 

0.1 using hint index 

3. implement it as a library 

3.1 think about concurrency control 

1. how to implement a merge:
    1.1 what's the size for each file
    1.2 when touching the merge
    1.3 when deleting the unnecessary old file 

concurrency control in the upper level for writing 

deal with client server model
    (client server model, or just a library? )


#### 4 code optimization

#### 5 think about the test case
